# Angular Local Storage Pensieve

On the accompanying page we have a [Pensieve][pensieve]: a tool for
storing memories. The only problem is that it's leaking!

### Goals

Using the `index.html` as a starting-point for your view template, write
an Angular app that implements the interactions:

- on submitting the form, a new row is added to the memories table,
- on clicking on the remove button ('x') on a memory, it is removed,
- on clicking on the 'Clear All' button, it is removed.
