# Local Storage Pensieve

On the accompanying page we have a [Pensieve][pensieve]: a tool for
storing memories. The only problem is that it's leaking!

### Goals

#### Part 1

Use `localStorage` to persist the data between page refreshes. Use the
[API docs at MDN][mdn-storage-api] to help you.

#### Part 2

1. Add remove buttons (links with the letter 'x') to each memory.
2. Add a "Clear" button to the Pensieve that removes all of the memories.
